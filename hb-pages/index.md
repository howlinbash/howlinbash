Hi, I'm Bash and this is my blog.

**Welcome.**

I'm a web developer based in sunny London. 

I â™¥ 
 - computers
 - the open web
 - javascript
 - open source software
 - linux
 - python
 - and that film where Keanu Reeves pwns the robots.

This blog is mostly about computers.

If you're thinking of hiring me, check out my [CV]({{site.url}}/cv) and send me an email.

If you'd like to get in touch for any other reason, go right ahead.
