    <p>I am an experienced and diligent, self-taught, junior web developer with exceptional communication and interpersonal skills. I've been building websites since 2010 and writing clean, maintainable programs in JavaScript, Python and Bash for over 2 years. I am obsessed with computers. Fascinated by the way they work and the way they transform society. I am determined and eager to help build an open source future.</p>

  <h2>Employment</h2>

  <div class="cv-job">
    <p class="cv-job-title">Middleware JavaScript Developer [freelance - remote]</p>
    <p class="cv-job-dates">erbridge ltd ~ October 2015 - February 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A multi-room live-chat middleware built with: Express, Node.js, Socket.io & Handlebars.</li>
      <li>After deciding against adapting pre-built solutions we resolved to code from the ground up. This meant I had to teach myself Express, Handlebars and the poorly documented Socket.io from scratch.</li>
      <li>The initial structure of the middleware was designed in collaboration with my manager but as my skills increased so did my role and from December onwards, I was the sole contributor to the codebase.</li>
      <li>Using regex, I designed slash commands for users to DM admins and admins to block, ban or DM users.</li>
      <li>As well as greatly improving my vanilla JavaScript skills, this project taught me a modular, clean code style, a powerful, modular Git method and introduced me to design patterns.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Latest Project</h2>

  <div class="cv-job">
    <p><span class="cv-job-title">HowlinBash.com</span><span class="cv-job-dates"> ~ 2017</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A static blog/portfolio website built with Jekyll, Bash, Sass & Docker.</li>
      <li>Taking lessons learned from my Docker server cluster. I began this project by designing an encrypted reverse proxy NGINX server before forking and adapting a ready made solution from GitHub.</li>
      <li>After choosing Jekyll as my site generator, I decided to build the site from three repositries:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple repo with all my markdown blogposts.</li>
          <li>A seperate jekyll theme - Heidi - forked from Hyde by @mdo and packaged as a gem on rubygems.org</li>
          <li>A final repo that imports the posts and the gem theme, adds modifications and builds a Docker image.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Building a stand-alone theme alongside the website, with local and live test environments lead me to utilize my significant Bash skills to develop a build script to minimize errors and increase productivity.</li>
    </ul>
